## Projects

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **LiftUp**, an application that connects sports coaches with their students. The goal is to provide a robust platform for managing training schedules, selling personalized workout programs, and creating tailored training sessions. Coaches can build and distribute their programs, track progress, and communicate with their clients, while users can access professional guidance, follow structured routines, and monitor their fitness journey â€” all in one place.

I also had the opportunity to work on various projects, including:

- **LiftUp**: A comprehensive platform for sports coaching and training program management, designed to enhance the relationship between coaches and their clients by offering communication tools, workout builders, and program sales features.

- **DriveUp**: A collaborative project developed during my apprenticeship â€” a carpooling application inspired by Blablacar. It allows users to search for and book rides, post trips, and manage their journeys easily through an intuitive interface.

## Actively Looking for a Job

I am currently seeking a **job opportunity** starting in September. I'm motivated to join a team where I can continue to grow, contribute meaningfully, and apply my skills in real-world scenarios. If you're hiring or open to collaboration, feel free to contact me!
